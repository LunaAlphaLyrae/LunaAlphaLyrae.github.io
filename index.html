								Most M dwarfs exhibit high levels of activity in the form of flares and coronal mass ejections due to magnetic reconnection processes. 
								This energetic activity may subject planets, orbiting around them, to significantly more radiation than we receive from the Sun. 
								Just how much this affects a planet’s potential habitability remains unclear. My team and I are using ultraviolet and X-ray observations from Swift, 
								combined with simultaneous TESS 20-second cadence optical data, as well as with X-ray observations from NICER, 
								to proving valuable information about our understanding of flare physics. Using such high-cadence data has allowed us to more accurately 
								assess flare energy partition and estimate the overall energy output of a flaring star, allowing us to investigate relationships between 
								optical, UV, and X-ray activity for low mass stars and their effect on planet atmospheres.

								<b> <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021PhDT.........3V/abstract">Dissertation</a> Project:</b> RV Tauri Variables</b><br>
							<span class="image main">
								<img src="images/umon_rvb_lightcurve.gif" alt="RVb light curve gif" width="600" height="338" class="center"/>
							</span>
								The gif shows an animation, and AAVSO light curve, of the second brightest RV Tauri variable, U Monocerotis, 
								a system of a pulsating post-AGB star and smaller stellar companion orbiting each other within a large circumbinary disk of dust. Credit: NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center/Chris Smith (USRA/GESTAR)<br> 
								The light curve shows the evolved star's deep and shallow minima due to pulsations, 
								as well as the pulsating star being eclipsed by the disk, also known as the RVb phenomonon.<br>
								RV Tauri variables are luminous pulsating supergiant stars (~10^3 Lsun) with pulsation periods between ~20--150 days and extend the period--luminosity relation 
								of Type II Classical Cepheids. In addition to pulsational variability, a subset of RV Tauri stars (the RVb-type) exhibits a longer periodic modulation in brightness 
								ranging between ~470 and 2800 days. It has been argued that RV Tauri variables are a subclass of post-asymptotic giant branch objects, evolved from low-to-intermediate mass stars. 
								However, their evolution is not so simple. The majority, if not all, are in binary systems surrounded by a circumbinary disk. Though binarity has been shown to play a key role in 
								the dynamics and evolution of these old systems, the interconnection between the various physical processes remains poorly understood. My dissertation focused on the 
								multiwavelength observational analysis of two archetypal RVb systems, DF Cygni and U Monocerotis. 
								In these two systems we found evidence for disk obscuration, 
								binary interaction, and disk evolution. I also showed how ultraprecise Kepler telescope observations of DF Cygni, 
								the only RV Tauri system in Kepler's original field-of-view, demonstrates that the periodic photometric RVb phenomenon 
								is linked to disk obscuration of the pulsating star. I also introduced observations spanning the largest coverage 
								of the electromagnetic spectrum (X-ray to millimeter) and longest temporal baseline of the RVb system U Monocerotis, 
								which also becomes the first RV Tauri system detected in X-rays, using XMM-Newton. 
								This has opened new possibilities for considering X-rays in forthcoming studies 
								to place further constraints and a deeper understanding of magnetism and accretion 
								of these evolved binary systems.
